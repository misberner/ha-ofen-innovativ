# Ofen Innovativ for Home Assistant

This is a Home Assistant integration for fireplaces with an [Ofen Innovativ](https://www.ofen-innovativ.de/) control unit. It exports various pieces of
information about the fireplace (temperature, burn phase, burn duration etc.) as sensors.

The integration was developed as a personal, free time project, by reverse engineering the fireplace web interface. I am not affiliated with nor have I ever been in contact with Ofen Innovativ.

**CAUTION:** This integration comes with absolutely no guarantees. It could damage your Home Assistant installation, your fireplace control unit, or cause physical damage to your fireplace or home. Sensor readings could be completely wrong. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

Heavily based on the [official HomeAssistant IntelliFire integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/intellifire).
